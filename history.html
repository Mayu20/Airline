    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As Tata Air Services
    Tata Air Service
    Air India had its origin as Tata Air Services later renamed to Tata Airlines founded by J. R. D. Tata of Tata Sons,
    an Indian aviator and business tycoon. In April 1932, Tata won a contract to carry mail for Imperial Airways and
    the aviation department of Tata Sons was formed with two single-engine de Havilland Puss Moths. On 15 October 1932,
    Tata flew a Puss Moth carrying air mail from Karachi to Bombay (currently Mumbai) and the aircraft continued to
    Madras
    (currently Chennai) piloted by Nevill Vintcent, a former Royal Air Force pilot and friend of Tata.[13] The airline
    fleet
    consisted of a Puss Moth aircraft and a de Havilland Leopard Moth.
    Initial service included weekly airmail service between Karachi and Madras via Ahmedabad and Bombay. In its first
    year of
    operation, the airline flew 160,000 miles (260,000 km), carrying 155 passengers and 9.72 tonnes (10.71 tons) of mail
    and
    made a profit of â‚¹60,000 (US$870).
